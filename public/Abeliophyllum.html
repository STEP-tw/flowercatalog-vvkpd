          <span>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</span> is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
          <span>Abeliophyllum</span> distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea, where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia,
          but differs in having white, not yellow, flowers.
          <br><br>
          It is a deciduous shrub growing to
          1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide,
          pubescent both above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring before the
          new leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed
          corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm diameter.
          <br><br>
          It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.
